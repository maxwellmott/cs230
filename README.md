The Gaming Room is a game development studio that is trying to create a version of
their game that can eventually be expanded to multiple platforms. They hired me to 
design the architecture that would allow their games to support online multiplayer.

In this documentation, I did my very best to answer any possible questions and address
all constraints. I think I did well at communicating all of my decisions and the
reasoning that lead me to them

The UML diagrams really help when you're developing software with a team. It was 
really nice having a diagram to consult if I had any confusion about the intended
structure.

I would choose my work on the last two sections of the document if I had to revise
any of my work. I just think I could have done a better job researching each
different system if I had known more of what to expect from this course and the 
project at hand.

It's important to think about a user standpoint even when you're developing software
via someone else's specific instructions. In this project, I tried to think about what
would be easiest and most convenient for the user, even if that wasn't the main 
concern. For example, I mentioned in the final section that there should be an error
message to the user if there is an issue with server connectivity. Even though you're
making the software for the client, the user's response to it is what the client will
use to measure your work.

I always try to keep my code clean and DRY. When I start to develop a piece of
software, I always begin by making a list of all the functions the software will need.
Once I have that, it's just a matter of finding the most optimal way for all of those
functions to work in tandem with one another according to the intended platform.
